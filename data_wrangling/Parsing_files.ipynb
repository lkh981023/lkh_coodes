       "'[\\'This is worth it for the convenience and the space-saving way it clips underneath the Dell Ultrasharp screen. The sound is clear but lacking in punch in the mid-range and with poor bass response, but that is inevitable for a speaker of this size and weight. Four stars because it is good. Not 5 stars because it is not excellent.\\', \"Just received the sound bar and installation was easy.  It has decent sound for what it is, a small speaker.  If you want great sound, this is wrong product.  I clips right onto the bottom of the monitor (but you better make sure you have the correct Dell monitor for this speaker) so it is office the desktop.I have one question for the designers.  The monitor has 4 powered USB ports.  Why did you design a product that required the AC/DC converter and speaker cable rather than have it plug into the USB port that is 2 inches away?  Also, that blue light did not have to be so bright.  It is dead on center and really annoying.  If you had placed the light 6 inches to the side, the grill would have blocked the direct light.  Just give me the knowledge to know that it is on and don\\'t blind me with the fact.  I am about to go to my workbench for a piece of tape to cover the lightFor these two design annoyances, the product losses 1 star.  However, if you have the right monitor and want to free up deskspace, go for it.\", \\'I got this because it was good price and its works as intended. It has worked flawlessly for years on end.\\', \\'The speaker bar arrived on time as expected and was a reasonable price. Much cheaper than Dell!\\', \\'This sound bar is easy to install, works as advertised and takes up no desk space.The delivery was prompt. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is the fidelity. This unit replaced a couple of 4 inch base reflex enclosures. Needless to say they sounded a lot better. They also cluttered up the desk a lot. If you want compact an reasonable sound this item is for you. If your looking for big sound spend a lot of money on something else.\\', \\'Use the sound bar every day looks great, works great and take up no rook on my desk.\\', \"Ordered, but not received.  I have seen this product on monitors in offices and they seem like a great product.  I purchaced a similar product for my wife\\'s monitor to remove the clutter caused by the speakers.  I gave it four stars because I would expect that it is as excellent a product as the one that I purchased from another source.  Hope that helps.\", \\'Put this on a Dell p1911 monitor and it looks and works just fine-  my monitor has a power plug built in for this speaker, so i didnt even need the power supply that came with it- but, nice to have an extra power supply anyway.installing is a matter of \"line it up! click in place!\"  plug power cord into monitor and plug into headphone jack on pc/laptop-  about 1 min total-btw- mine was brand new and still sealed in dell box!  from  Wildcat IT  thx WILDCAT\\', \\'The item works good and got power directly from the monitor.  The item is not new but it is used!  The title is somewhat misleading.\\', \\'Clearly these came from an office where they were used for years and years. they are dented scratched and the cables have been bent considerably. If you have a product that is used SELL IT THAT WAY!\\', \\'just what I needed for a new Dell ultra pc monitor I purchased amazing value for quality of this type of product\\', \\'I have one of these, love it, but this one they sent with no power supply so I had to return.  Useless.\\', \"This is older (Silver)version for the Dell Ultrasharp series now replaced by a similar (black) unit, which based on other reviews, is inferior to this older unit.  No need for a power adapter if using on an Ultrasharp.  Reduces cord clutter (you do have run the audio plug to your workstation and a short plug into the back of your dell monitor) and switches on/off with monitor or when powering PC off.  Good sound for what it is - great for my work computers but not much bass.  Better than some cheap desktop speakers I\\'ve purchased. Get \\'em while you can.\", \"I had a dell speaker that was 8 years old and broke so I got this similar one to replace it works well so far and sounds just like it should nothing to bad it\\'s a little louder than I thought for a computer speaker but not great sound since it is a computer speaker, got here fast and easy to install.\", \"I recently purchased an Ultrasharp display from Dell and accessorized it with a sound bar as I did previously with two other Ultrasharps.  The sound bar from Dell was different than the past ones.  Apparently Dell replaced their silver-faced AS501 with a new black-faced AX510.  Although the specifications are the same, the sound from the new AX510 is harsh and lacks bass.  Laptop speakers sound better!If you\\'re mixing the next Dark Side of the Moon, or need your ears to bleed while fragging imps, the AS501 probably isn\\'t for you.  If you\\'re looking for reasonable sound and reduced desk clutter, the AS501 is worth considering.The AS501 has other design features worth mentioning:- It has earphone jacks on the left side which are easy to access and have the added benefit of keeping the headphone cable away from the keyboard and (right hand) mouse.  Plugging in earphones cuts the sound to the speakers for private listening.- When plugged into a Dell Ultrasharp display, the AS501 turns off when the monitor goes into standby mode saving even more power.  Newer Ultrasharp monitors can bypass this feature via the display\\'s menu.Until I hear that Dell has improved the sound of the sound bars they sell, I\\'ll be buying AS501s from the sellers here.\"]'"

I clips right onto the bottom of the monitor (but you better make sure you have the correct Dell monitor for this speaker) so it is office the desktop.I have one question for the designers.  The monitor has 4 powered USB ports.  Why did you design a product that required the AC/DC converter and speaker cable rather than have it plug into the USB port that is 2 inches away?  Also, that blue light did not have to be so bright.  It is dead on center and really annoying.  If you had placed the light 6 inches to the side, the grill would have blocked the direct light.  Just give me the knowledge to know that it is on and don't blind me with the fact.  I am about to go to my workbench for a piece of tape to cover the lightFor these two design annoyances, the product losses 1 star.  However, if you have the right monitor and want to free up deskspace, go for it. </p>\\n\",\n",

       " \" <p> I recently purchased an Ultrasharp display from Dell and accessorized it with a sound bar as I did previously with two other Ultrasharps.  The sound bar from Dell was different than the past ones.  Apparently Dell replaced their silver-faced AS501 with a new black-faced AX510.  Although the specifications are the same, the sound from the new AX510 is harsh and lacks bass.  Laptop speakers sound better!If you're mixing the next Dark Side of the Moon, or need your ears to bleed while fragging imps, the AS501 probably isn't for you.  If you're looking for reasonable sound and reduced desk clutter, the AS501 is worth considering.The AS501 has other design features worth mentioning:- It has earphone jacks on the left side which are easy to access and have the added benefit of keeping the headphone cable away from the keyboard and (right hand) mouse.  Plugging in earphones cuts the sound to the speakers for private listening.- When plugged into a Dell Ultrasharp display, the AS501 turns off when the monitor goes into standby mode saving even more power.  Newer Ultrasharp monitors can bypass this feature via the display's menu.Until I hear that Dell has improved the sound of the sound bars they sell, I'll be buying AS501s from the sellers here. </p>\\n\",\n",

       "[[\"if you are someone like me who has ingested just about every crime media from sweden and scandinavia, the problem becomes you start getting picky.  there is only so much new and different which can be done in crime shows and the swedes have already broken all records with wallander and salander.  of the females in crime detecting in sweden, liz salander is the best, from the millenium trilogy.  then irene huss comes next.  and finally maria wern, the cop in this series.  dare i say it?  she is almost too normal.she does not have any quirks which make her stand out from the pack although she is arguably the best looking..in sum, i liked these cases with wern but i didn't love them.  if more were released tomorrow, i'd skip them.  if you have not seen much of swedish crime shows though, only american ones, it will probably strike you as terrific.\",\n",
       "  \"The acting, story-lines,images and editing for this series are second-rate......spend your $$$$$ and time on series such as Silent Witness, Waking the Dead, Foyle's War or Dexter. Maria Wern has all the charm of a washcloth. I wasted my $$$ on this.......such is life.\",\n",
       "  'This time its the female detective doing all the thinking bringing a feminine approach to things. This series has freshened  up the well made Swedish cop series with some beauty as well as brains.',\n",
       "  'This police/detective series, \"Maria Wern\" is a highly intense Swedish (with sub-titles) \"Police drama\" that, for me, is filmed in a very different part of the world (albeit a very pretty part of the world), that being on an island, with gorgeous sun-sets, in Sweden.  Maria Wern (wonderfully and very believably acted by Eva Rose--don\\'t be fooled by her looks, she\\'s tough), while always very concerned for her family and while very intently mourning the death of her husband, is a \"super\" cop  solving some very well written and directed horrible cases including a teen girl\\'s(with a surprising secret) suicide, baby kidnapping,  ardent \"animal rights\" advocates that will use any means possible to get their points across, etc. I found all three (3) of the hour and one-half episodes to be very intriguing and \"nail biting \"good.This series was acquired, by me, by accident (long story); however, I enjoyed it very much and intend to purchase more episodes in the series.',\n",
       "  \"Maria Wern was a real disappointment. Eva Rose, who plays Maria. expresses emotion mainly by letting her hair hang loose to her elbows or, in tense scenes, putting it in a french braid. I don't know if she's trying to exprerss scandanavian stoicism or if she's just had too much botox, but she cycles through two facial expressions whether rescuing her daughter friom a murderess or greeting an old lover. And I am getting tired of female detectives in authority being presented with a cop on staff who looks like a matinee idol, complete with chiseled features and six-pack abs. You just roll your eyes.\",\n",
       "  'I am impressed with this series.  It\\'s powerful, suspenseful, and well-plotted. There\\'s good character development bolstered by an emotional \"pull\" that draws the viewer into caring about the people portrayed.  That extra dimension proves the skill of both the screenwriters and the actors.  The story line revolves around the character of Maria Wern, a seasoned police officer who is also a recent widow with two young children. Maria is played intelligently and sensitively by Eva Rose. The struggles that she endures, putting their lives back on track while pursuing her career as a senior police officer, resonate with the viewer as a genuine effort --  it is not a cliche-ridden treatment , or an overly-emotional one. The character does not wallow in self-pity; neither is she so numbed by her own suffering that she\\'s devoid of compassion for others.  It\\'s a believable blend. The other ensemble actors are also very good and their characters seem fleshed-out and nuanced --they are people one can relate to and come to care about. Personally, I found this especially true of Maria\\'s boss, Thomas.  Thankfully, he is not portrayed as the typical stock character of a gruff-but-indulgent boss, or an administrator more concerned with the departmental budget than with effective policing. Neither is he a chauvinist who patronizes Maria.  It\\'s so refreshing to have professionals portrayed as decent, normal folks who can rise above petty jealousies to do their jobs as a team. The plots are fairly inventive, though I\\'ve seen a similar opening gambit in another series (it\\'s shocking and haunting, so heads-up). A further point is that it is offered in Swedish, but the subtitles are excellent and do not detract from the viewing experience. Overall, then, I do recommend this series as being intelligent, well-done, and compelling.',\n",

Gratuitous elements are added for dramatic effect/shock value, rather than in service to a tight plot (example- **spoiler alert**- in episode one the severed head in the well made sense, the others, not so much).

I liked that time was taken to reveal particulars of characters' experiences (Maria looking longingly at her husband's photo, the chief interacting with his wife's dog) but for me the personal didn't go deep enough, I didn't feel I knew/understood these people, maybe too subtle for me.

       " [\"Cherry Blossoms (2008) film by Doris Dorrie is a beautiful film, but can be painful to watch.  But to feel pain or any extreme emotion, then the director has done her job.  At over 2 hours, it didn't feel it unusually lengthy, because one becomes engrossed in the telling of a man so tormented by guilt over his wife's death.  The story takes place in Germany, but for the latter part, the setting is Japan, with beautiful scenery, especially the cherry blossom trees.It begins where a woman discovers her husband has a terminal illness and she encourages a visit to be with their children, two who live in Germany, and one in Tokyo.  And immediately upon their arrival, we learn how disconnected they are to the children who don't go out of their way for them.  You can feel this tension, discomfort, unsettling atmosphere.  Suprisingly, it is the wife who has departed this world.  Her husband learns how she had desires, dreams, and a passion for Japan and Butoh dancing, dancing in white body makeup, slow movements, playful or grotesque imagery.What follows after this death is the sad part, how an elderly man has succumbed to abnormalities in grief or dealing with guilt.  It is painful to watch the odd behavior, the lonliness, coldness from family, the indignities, but beautiful to see how his quest evolves, and a endearing friendship with a street performer.Casing Elmar Wepper as Rudi was a brilliant move.  How much can you read on this man's face, the body language. His acting was wonderful, so very real.Doris Dorrie is one of Germany's important female directors.

I am quite surprised other reviewers have not mentioned the quintessential role of the young woman playing the mysterious Japanese dancer, for she is the real center of the story.  There are so many other things I could say, but I am still \"in the movie\" as it were.  Simply A GREAT WORK OF ART!',\n",
       "  \"At the core of `Cherry Blossoms' is a sincere portrait of loss and the desire to reconnect with loved ones we feel as though we've never truly connected with.  It's hard to describe this film without giving away a very key plot point that is heavily disguised in the product description, so I'm struggling with how to really review this film.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so being vague is the name of the game, which is hard for me.This is going to be a short review, apparently.`Cherry Blossoms' tells the story of an elderly couple who are trying, on the outset of the film, to connect with their scattered children.  Trudi has learned some health news supposedly regarding her husband and so, without a word on the subject, she persuades him to visit their three children.  It is apparent that their children don't have time for them, don't want to make time for them and quite frankly don't like spending time with them.  Then something tragic happens and the film attempts to depict loss in a unique way.  I feel like I can't say much more on the subject.As much as I respect some of the choices made here, and as much as I really adore the performance by Elmar Wepper, I found too many nagging details here that make this fall short in my eyes.  The depiction of the children in particular is beyond off-putting.  They are all ungrateful, spoiled, selfish, heartless brats and I can't fathom how they got to where they are.  I never in my life wanted to smack so many people, and for pointless and rather stupid things.  The relationship that forms between Rudi and a street performer is strange and doesn't really add to the weight of the film's themes.  It actually takes away from them because it is, in a sense, distracting, especially once he starts getting personally invested with her and her situation.  It took away from what the film should have been about.Alas, it has its moments and Wepper really is sensational (he reminds me in a way of Tom Wilkinson), but the film gets derailed in the second half, right when it should have been building a stronger investment.\",\n",

       "  'Cherry Blossoms is an oddly absorbing film. The story is presented in two parts: The first half takes place in Germany and focuses on the inter-generational tension resulting from a visit of the patents (Rudi and Trudi) to see their grown children, who are too busy and do not want to be bothered. In the midst of their visit, Trudi unexpectedly dies in her sleep and Rudi is devastated (not so much out of love as out of need: Rrudi is a rather self-absorbed and selfish person). This part of the film is entirely too long and could easily be cut in half (but suffer through it. The second half is a gem). The second half, which takes place in Tokyo after Trudi dies, focuses on two people: Rudi and a young homeless girl who practices modern Japanese dance in the park in order to communicate with her dead mother. This is where Rudi begins his journey of self-discovery from his self-adsorbed personage into a more spiritual relationship with his dead wife.  The Japanese scenery brings the spiritual themes into sharp focus. Cherry Blossoms has an unexpectedly strong emotional punch.',\n",
       "  'Andrew Sarris (film critic of the New York Observer) called this the first \"great\" film of 2009 and it is hard to disagree. Although it is a German film, it is infused with an Asian, particularly a Japanese point of view.  Central to the film is the Butoh dance which was developed as an abstract form of modern dance. It meant originally - dance of darkness. When first performed, the dance was a subversive art form but today it resembles expressionist modern dance - possibly influenced by the traditional Noh technique.In content and in form, the film is a poem of love.  When an elderly wife realizes her husband has only a short time to live, she keeps the information a secret but tries to get him involved with visiting the children (after a long absence) and beginning an adventure, completing the things he wanted to do most but left undone.  It turns out that the wife dies first, unexpectedly. This momentous event causes the husband to re-examine his life and his relationships and to travel to Japan which his wife always wanted to do. And so he walks in his love\\'s path and in doing so eventually become totally united with her soul.The film is influenced by the well recognized Japanese film master Ozu - particularly his \"Tokyo Story\" - but I would say it ends on a more sublime note.  In every way, the symbol of the \"cherry blossom\" which blooms for just a short period of time but is exceptionally beautiful when it does, is the hidden meaning of the story.',\n",
       "  'My Top 10 Film List seems to get a little more expansive each year, but CHERRY BLOSSOMS is definitely on it. It is profound in its simplicity. The Plot: Wife (Hannelore Elsner) discovers that her husband (Elmar Wepper) of many years is dying. He doesn\\'t know it & she doesn\\'t tell him. She manages to arrange a trip with their adult chirldren living in Berlin, although he would prefer to stay home. The children aren\\'t informed about his condition. Wife dies unexpectedly. Husband is lost without her. He goes to visit son Karl who lives in Tokyo. Father hooks up with a young dancer. Karl assumes the worst.Those are the bare bones.What we learn about the relationships is where the more meaningful elements are revealed.For one thing, we learn that the wife has a more or less hidden love of the Japanese performance/dance called Butoh (boo-toe). It is not clear how this transpired since, until recently, Butoh was not well known outside Japan. An understanding of Butoh is really helpful when viewing CHERRY BLOSSOMS, but not absolutely necessary. Key elements are illustrated by Tadashi Endo in a scene set in Berlin where the dancer is performing. The girl (Aya Irizuki) in Japan (who is rehearsing outdoors a performance involving a pink telephone with a long cord) is a dedicated Butoh performer as well.The colors of pink, green & white are found everywhere in the movie, but subtly increase in intensity when the husband goes to Japan. I think I became aware of this only towards the end of the film, but when I watched the film again it was much more apparent. Naturally this represents the colors associated with \"Cherry Blossom Time\"--a sort of national event in Japan. I think the green symbolizes the leaves & the pink & white the flower. I also think white symbolizes death. It\\'s interesting how this color scheme is naturally enhanced in Japan, in the neon lights of Tokyo, in the food, and the kimonos quests all wear in an informal hotel near Mt. Fuji.As for Butoh, it emerged as a performance art in post-WWII Japan, partially as a reaction to the the restriction imposed on dancers by the traditional Nh. There are 2 main types of Butoh. One is the basically non-movement variety, and the other that relies on agility and at least some familiarity with traditional dance, even ballet. The images portrayed are more often than not, visceral themes of death, blood--and eventual trandscendece. The artists are almost nude (with body paint) in many scenes. Elements of lighting & set are important & reflect post-WWI German expressionism. I believe it has influenced performers like Marilyn Manson, Madonna & others, and films like The Cell. It is distictly surrealistic.When the wide goes to the Berlin performance, she tries to coach her husband, but he will not go. Instead he waits outside the theatre, staring at the walls with artistic graffeti. Clearly, he is a man set in ways, resistant to change. Be that as it may, that evening he watches as his wife begins to dance, and she finally gets him to do some movements with her. This scene was powerful because it showed just how devoted he was to her.Their children don\\'t undertand them, particularly him. There is residual resentment against him resulting from his rather aloof parenting. They resented that their mother was so solicitous In fact there is a strong suggestion that the lone daughter is a Lesbian, carrying on light-hearted dalliance with her sister-in-law (who is the only member of the immediate family who seems sympathetic to either parent.) With the death of their mother in Berlin, they don\\'t know what to do with their father. He solves their dilemma by suddenly going to Tokyo to vistit the single son who lives there.The father goes basically unannounced & definitely not invited. He takes a single suitcase with him. Among the few items in it are his wife\\'s (cherry blossom) kimono, her (green) sweater, skirt and...all the money he has cleaned out from his bank account.And here this review ends, I don\\'t want to give any more away.Well, two more things. The actress who plays the Butoh artist is absolutely wonderful. She appears to be a trained dancer & acts a messenger from the world of the living to the realm of the dead.The sequence in Japan has a startling & perfectly cathartic conclusion.Dancing Into Darkness: Butoh, Zen, and JapanKazuo Ohno\\'s World: from without & withinHijikata Tatsumi and Ohno Kazuo (Routledge Performance Practitioners)The Body Speaks: Performance and ExpressionTowards the Bowels of the Earth: Butoh Writhing in PerspectivesOf Another World: Dancing Between Dream and RealityThe Art of Stillness: The Theater Practice of Tadashi Suzuki',\n",
       "  'One of the most accomplished, beautiful, transcendent movies I\\'ve seen in the last decade:  a German family\\'s relationship to Japan.  It hovers delicately around the central spiritual meanings of both Buddhism and Christianity, without mentioning either.  Cherry Blossoms is about love, love between husband and wife, between the West and East.  A movie about tolerance and forgiveness too.The director Doris Dorrie has traversed this territory before somewhat in her previous movie \"Enlightenment Guaranteed\".I believe in life after death, and this movie celebrates that belief with great sublimity and joy.Dancing too is a core element in the structure of the story.  In addition, Dorrie has chosen the way to a music soundtrack which again melds the East and West, using little known sources such as the exquisite Japanese acoustic group of Shunsuke Mizuno.A great and moving film, I give it my highest recommendation.  A movie to renew what is meaningful to your life.',\n",

Only the daughter's female lover seems interested in them at all. They then go on to the sea where the elderly wife sadly dies in her sleep. The grief stricken husband Rudi decides to go and visit his third adult child in Japan, a place his wife had longed to visit. He stays in Tokyo with his semi-alcoholic, workaholic son who has no time or patience for his father either and can't wait for him to leave. Seeking distraction from his grief Rudi meets an 18 year old street performer, Butoh dancer named Yu in a cherry blossom filled park when he explores Tokyo. He strikes up a poetical and poignant relationship with her. Yu is working on her own grief issues after her mother's death a year before. She is the only person in the movie who truly has time for and understanding of Rudi.  This movie has a lot of emotional depth and is definitely melancholy and sentimental as it touches on mourning and regret. Hidden in this movie there are also moments of joyfulness and a lot of exploration of what it means to truly touch and be touched by another person. The pacing is slow like Butoh dancing itself and the movie slowly opens like the vulnerable petal of a perfect cherry blossom. This is now one of my new, favorite Japanese movies even though it is actually a German movie.  I loved it and I recommend it for those wanting to go on a soul searching journey that may leave you in tears in parts especially if you have suffered profound losses in your own life. Everything in life is about impermanence and this movie is a lesson in seeking out the elegant even in the mundane and embracing life.

No!It is a loving and systematic look at the dynamics of a family of five, what they mean to each other, and the harvest of their individual life choices. The parents are an elderly couple with three grown kids - one girl and two boys. The couple is so close, they are separated by just one letter (i.e. Rudi and Trudi). They live very simply in an alpine area of Bavaria where he is a waste management official, while his wife is the doting hausfrau.

She decides not to tell him, preferring instead to take him out of his routine and visit the kids, and go for a vacation at the Baltic seaside. She is adventurous and has an inquisitive mind, while he is cocooned in his predictably routine life. They live in a chalet with gingerbread staircase and antlers on the wall. While at the beach he tells her he wants to go back home. He cannot understand her fascination with Japan or the strange dance form called Butoh (the shadow dance of the soul). Unexpectedly, she dies at the beach [don\\'t worry, this film is about the soul, not plot].The kids and the daughter\\'s female lover meet their dad at the beach and remember Trudi.

       "  \"'Cherry Blossoms' is a quiet film that sneaks into your heart and is so unpredictable in interesting ways.  This film shows us the cultural differences between Japanese and German lives.  This is a story of Trudi and Rudi, a Bavarian couple, and their grown children who have grown apart and find little time for their parents.Trudi is called into their physician's office to be told that Rudi has a terminal disease, and she is asked if Rudi should be told. She does not respond, but we know her decision is 'no'. She is advised he has some time and a trip of their lifetime might be a good choice. Right away my hackles rose, how unethical- but as the film moves on I forgot this ethical lapse and fell into the story.  Trudi talks hard working Rudi into visiting their two children in Berlin. Even though she would much prefer to visit their son, Karl in Japan. Trudi has had a life long yearning to study the Japanese dance, Butoh and to visit Mt. Fuji. But,l she has devoted her life to her husband and her children. Karl, it seems was her favorite and the other children lived with this knowledge.  Off they go to Berlin instead, to find their children immersed in their own lives with no time for them. It is the lover of one of the children who makes the most time for them, and begins to understand Trudi as a woman not only a mother. Complications arise and soon Rudi finds that the woman he called his wife was also someone who had other interests. He visits Karl in Tokyo and once again it is someone outside the family who spends time with Rudi and understands the grief that has enveloped him. A young girl develops a friendship with him, and it is she who has studied Butho dancing and shows Rudi his expressive, artistic side.The German filmmaker, Doris D&ouml;rrie has made a marvelous emotionally full film about this German couple.  Trudi played by Hannelore Eisner and Rudi, played by Elmer Wrapper, grow on us. We can feel their bonds and the family issues; their children with busy lives without time for them. The title of the film, Cherry Blossoms, takes it name from the Tokyo blooms, that bloom for just a short time. We find that Rudi transforms and that the life he led with his wife, Trudi was indeed a special one, and in the end it is those we love that make our lives what they are.A lovely film about love, life and death. The Japanese dance Butoh brings a special expression into this film that will resonate for a long time. The film is a travelogue in part and we get to visit the exquisite countries of Germany and Japan.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 08-02-09Where Do We Go From Here?\",\n",

The opening scenes in the sweet little Bavarian village are wonderful.  Then...Tokyo, which is mostly frightening...and finally Mt.Fuji, which is as lovely as anyone could imagine.The story is wonderful.  It centers on a very ordinary, middle aged man who likes to do everything the same way, every day and his wife who would love to visit Japan but never does.  The family dynamics are at times hard to watch but they are unfortunately quite realistic.  The film shows the ordinariness of these well ordered, sensible, middle class German people and the extraordinary magical loveliness of a young girl who dances in the park during the day, in full costume, and who sleeps in a tent at night.  The girl gives the man the love and kindness and understanding that his children don't.The cast is perfect.  The man, who is not the type to show his feelings, nonetheless is very moving.  The wife is quite beautiful, even in her older years.  The young Japanese dancer will win your heart...she is extraordinary.It's hard to describe the emotional impact that this film has.  I found it amazing...not just  by showing the depth of sorrow and grief of life but also the incredible beauty that it holds.  The closing scenes at Mt.

       "  'When her husband is diagnosed with a terminal illness, a German woman named Trudi decides it\\'s time the both of them paid a long overdue visit to their adult children - two of whom live in Berlin and one in Japan.  The catch is that the husband, Rudi, doesn\\'t even know he\\'s sick and neither do the kids.  Thus, Trudi must live with this horrible secret while putting on a brave face for those around her.  But then a different, wholly unforeseen tragedy strikes the family and the movie heads off into an entirely new and utterly unanticipated direction from where we thought it was going.A German movie set largely in Japan, \"Cherry Blossoms\" is a beautiful and heartbreaking film about living for the moment and of not putting off till tomorrow what you can do today.  It\\'s also marvelously perceptive about the dynamics of parent/child relationships, especially when, as is true in this case, the parents are viewed by their self-absorbed offspring more as burdens to be endured than blessings to be cherished.  The irony is that Rudi and Trudi have more in common with - and indeed are treated better by - many of the strangers and casual acquaintances they come in contact with than they are by their own children.But the movie is also an examination of marriage and of how partners can become so entwined with one another as a couple that they lose their identities as individuals, missing out on the dreams and goals they had for their lives when they were still young and unattached.  This is certainly the case for Trudi, who has harbored a lifelong desire to take up Japanese dancing, a desire that Rudi, in his selfish indifference, has pretty much squelched in her for the duration of their marriage.  Such a realization of lost opportunities can lead to regrets, recriminations and despair at the end of the road, yet in the case of Rudi and Trudi, one learns that lesson a little too late - and the other just in the nick of time.Elmer Wepper and Hannelore Elsner are magnificent as the aged couple, superbly capturing the deep-seated but often unspoken love that each spouse has for the other.  A fine supporting cast, led by Maximilian Bruckner as one of their sons and Aya Irizuki as a young street artist who befriends Rudi in his time of greatest need, adds to the movie`s richness.  Another crucial element in the emotional force of the movie is the richly elegiac score by Claus Bantzer.The glory of this exquisitely realized and profoundly moving film is its willingness to grapple with some truly major issues - of life and death, of sorrow and loss, of filial and marital relationships - without getting heavy-handed and preachy about it in the process.  Every moment in this film feels real and unforced, yet the movie itself has the minutely worked-out grace and precision of Japanese performance art (which we see quite a bit of throughout the course of the film).  In fact, near the end, there is a fantasy dance sequence that is, quite frankly, one of the most utterly spellbinding and breathtaking scenes I`ve come across in ages.Masterfully directed by Doris Dorrie, \"Cherry Blossoms\" is a lyrical and unforgettable work that takes its place among the truly outstanding films of recent times.',\n",

If the reviews for the film tend to gush, it's because, like butoh itself, what it has to say about life and death can surprise and move you far out of your own daily routine.

Though quiet and accepting of his ways, she harbors a fire inside her that cannot be quenched except with travel and dance.Sad and beautiful, it is a moving story of loving and accepting the people we love and telling them before it is too late that they are lovely and wonderful.

       " ['I only gave it 4 stars..ONLY because I don\\'t like the short warm up in ever single segment..however, it\\'s not too much of a problem if you are doing them each on a single day..but for most like me who wants a long challanging workout, we like to do the whole entire thing, without having to do the warm up with each part. Kind of like how Cardio Explosion is..there is no fuss with chosing all segments, and having to fast forward each warmup. ;)Now I recently ordered the FIRM\\'s new \"Express System\", and I noticed that this workout is an introduction to how those might be..except more advanced. :) So I think this was made to have an idea of shorter intense workouts for their newest ones (which I have not yet received, but order is on its way). ;)As for the workout, not too hard, but more challanging then most of their newest \"pink FIRMS\". I\\'m glad because this one is sort of like their older ones (if only they would get rid of the warm ups when you choose to do (all 4) like I do. ;)All segments are nice and challanging..not as challanging as the new Cardio Explosion, but just enough. ;) The Cardio only segment is actually more killer (which is done by Emily). ;)ALL workouts went by fast...with FIRM videos (which I have been using for the past 15 years now, all have no boredom and is very famous for switching things up. This workout, you only need about 5-10lbs. I could use heavier, but like Cardio Explosion, some reps are fast, so you don\\'t go too heavy. Another thing that bugged me about this video, was that the bonus segment said you have to \"Download online\"...not sure why, and I\\'m guessing you have to become a member on their website..so that kind of peeved me off...it\\'s supposably another 10 min segment--but a \"total body one\"..I will update when I try to download it and let you know..other then that..not sure why it even showed up on the dvd...if it\\'s not even on there..>:(Most of all, I would also love a solid Abs-only segment, but then again, some moves in this workout DOES work your abs even tho you are not doing a solid lying down ab section (which for me anyway, I always feel more complete when having an option for just an ab section).Overall, grade A. Not A+ if they included the bonus ON the DVD, and not to have to go \"download\" on their website, and wishes you can bypass each warmup with each section when choosing to do all 4 workouts. Other then that, love this workout!!',\n",
       "  'The DVD contains 5 ten minute sections:Lean Leg DefinerFearless ArmsBikini Body BlazeABS-olute CoreBun BurnYou can play all or create a custom workout.  There are two differnt instructors Rebekah Sturkie and Emily Welsh, but only one per section.  I thought Rebekah Sturkie did overall a good job leading the workouts with cues, but I noticed a little problem with form.  She flexed her back when she did rows, and you are supossed to keep a straight back.  Emily Walsh\\'s workouts were so fast paced and not very many reps per move, so I had to rewind a few spots.  I like that each section has a mix of \"traditional\" moves like squats, lunges, push ups, and planks, but they added new twists.  They added intervals and isometric moves that burn a lot of calories.  They also incorprate moves that work your core and balance.  The short warm up for each section didn\\'t bother me like it did a previous reviewer, when I did all the sections togegher, so I think that could be personal choice.  I\\'m used to short warm-ups and cool downs per section from ten minute solution videos.  In fact, I like to add a longer yoga or pilates warm up and cool down, so I will be less sore the next day. Therefore, I actually recommend doing more than what\\'s on this DVD, if you do more than one section.  I think this DVD could help raise beginners to the next level on the target areas, but may not be enough on their own for intermediate exercisers.  I plan on doing all sections or adding them to other workouts.',\n",

I particularly love the lower body workouts. The only downside is that they move through the moves pretty quickly and since the workouts last 10mins; you don't really have a lot of time to learn the moves. However, you become more comfortable as you repeat workouts. In addition, this is consistent with The Firm programs. Calorie burn is good too.\",\n",
       "  'Great fat burners. You notice the results in a day or two.  although, always be careful, when your doing lunges, to modify your lunge exercises so you dont hurt your knees.  They do work and are only ten minute workout.  I like to do one workout at every break at work.',\n",

It's great if you really do just use each 10-minute segment separately, but if you decide to do all of them for a longer workout, it's too much of the same. It's supposed to be focused on different body parts: Legs, arms, bikini body, absolute core and bun burn. I didn't really feel the arms workout was enough focused on the arms, and not sure what the bikini body is supposed to do. The Absolute core is supposed to be abs, but again, there's movements in that that are so similar to the other sections that it doesn't deliver the arms workout; my arms didn't get worked out much at all. In the end, it seems like it's all mostly squats, which the firm does too much of anyways (for my taste), so I'm not thrilled with it and probably won't use it unless I do just want a 10-minute workout.\",\n",

Also, fingerprints stuck to this like mad...you could actually see the oil sitting on the glass very clearly.  Since it is obviously gorilla glass (the glass was solid to the touch, didn't have that soft 'give' the cheap copies have) but was unfinished (not having that protective coating)definitely leads me to believe these were either factory throw-aways someone snatched up or were taken then grey marketed.

I have nothing but great things to say about this part. Make sure to watch the iPad replacement videos before trying this yourself. It was not difficult, but very time consuming.

This gives the ipad2 a different feel as you can feel the glass flex when you push on the screen.  I would not trust any ipad repaired with this screen outside of an otter-box case.Finally, I received one with a manufacturing defect.  the inner touchscreen sensor array had a crack in it making the top 3/4 inch of the screen not responsive to any touches.  luckily after repairing 30 ipad 2's I have gotten in the habit of looking for this defect as it is very common of the knockoff screens to arrive damaged.If you know what you are doing and want a cheap fix just to sell your ipad off on ebay,  go for this screen.\",\n",
