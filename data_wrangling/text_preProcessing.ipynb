       "'\\'What a workhorse, we bought the Oly C-3000z around the end of 2000 and, until very recently,\\nhave used it at least a few times a week (almost every week) in our shop for product pictures. With a\\nresolution of 3.2mp, this camera takes pictures that are still good for web pages and most\\nadvertising flyers and prints we produce.It might seem odd to be writing a review for a camera this\\nold, but we are about to retire this one from the shop (replacing it withFujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP\\nSuper CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Triple Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD) and\\ngive it to one of my kids as a beater camera. I noticed that several of these cameras were being sold\\non Amazon as used (but not by me), and wanted to let people know that it is possible for there to be\\n\"life\" in a camera this old.Here are my general observations (+/-):+ Good Lens - 3x Optical Zoom-\\nShows \"Purple Fringing\" in some cases+ Good Solid Body - Feels good in the hand- Bad Lens Cap\\n- Replaced mine with a 3rd party one that is no longer made+ Good Movie Mode w/Sound - A nice\\nfeature when this camera was made- Uses SmartMedia Cards - Fairly low capacity, getting harder\\nto find, and many computers require usb adapters to read them+ Great Macro Mode - Very good for\\nour product pictures+ Remote Control - Suports a remote control, which is important for tripod shots\\nin low lightWe have taken 1000s of pictures with this camera, including two award winning photos,\\nand it likely will take many more.Highly recommended!\\', \"i am totally satisfied with olympus c-3000, i\\nwas told i would recieve the camera in the alotted time and was impressed when it came a few days\\nearly, my only problem with the package was it was missing a memory card, but two out of three\\nain\\'t bad!:)\", \\'made over 200,000 photos with it ... this camera made me decide to get the canon eos\\nm camera, since i have canon lenses and a canon 30d, which i use all the time , but cant take it with\\nme everywhere, as i did this olympus ... like they say, big cameras like my canon 30d stay home\\n95% of the time .... i recently got the canon 2500 pocket camera, but its very slow when you press\\ndown the shutter ... memories, many photos with this little olympus are on my facebook page ... and\\ni posted a photo of my doc of homeopathy, who brings people back to life from cancers to lupus ...\\',\\n\"I\\'ve used my C3000 for years. While it\\'s only 3.2MP, I momentarily relegated to a shoebox while a\\nnew 5MP Sony DSC-P93 took the limelight.I ended up selling the Sony and going back to the\\nOlympus, which takes outstanding shots indoors and out.\", \"I have had this camera going on 6 years\\nand it is still working strong and taking great picutres. Yes, there are newer cameras out there, but I\\nstill use this one. I replaced another brand digital camera in less than 6 months as it turned all\\npictures green with this model and no problems since. I got an all in 1 printer last year and my\\npictures download nicely to my computer with the HP printer software with no problems and I can\\nalso download family\\'s newer pictures too (other olypmus cameras.)\", \"After having a great time with\\na cheaper digital camera - a Sony DSC-S30 1.3 Megapixel - I decided to trade up to one of the 3+\\nmegapixel cameras.  I did extensive research comparing the top cameras, read countless reviews\\non photo websites, consumer reviews, etc.  The other cameras that I was seriously considering was\\nthe coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70.  I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a\\nbargain.  If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography, the C3000 has\\nalmost as much as the 990.  It has manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual focus, and\\nexposure bracketing to name a few.  But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well.  You get\\na rapid fire mode, which, though not blazingly fast, is still respectable and even increases quite a bit\\nwith focus set to manual.  Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio\\nclip, kind of an audio labeling.  There other cameras out there, notably the Cannon Powershot G1,\\nwhich has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable\\nfor taking candid shots.  But the G1 has image problems(Chromatic Aberations and noise), as does\\nthe 990(redeye).  All these cameras have plusses and minuses, but with one of the top-rated\\nimages and top-rated feature-set with a price that\\'s a couple hundred lower than most of the top\\ncameras, the C3000 really stands out!\", \"I had this Olympus for many years now and it\\'s still working\\nGREAT!  After Olympus, I\\'ve owned PowerShot, Finepix (2 of them) and I have to say this C3000 is\\nstill my favorite!  It\\'s the only camera I know that allows zoom function while recording video.\", \\'I\\\\\\'ve\\nclicked away through Costa Rica, Ireland, Lake Tahoe (skiing - finally lost the easily popped-off lens\\ncap) and many other places. Excellent camera - sometimes need to \"touch up\" photos, but overall\\n\\n\\x0csturdy, great image quality and full of features. I am extremely satified with Olympus cameras - both\\nfilm and digital (I also use Pentax film and Canon ELPH digital).\\', \"This is a nice camera. It is just the\\nright size - very small, but not too small to be hard to handle. The pictures we have taken with look\\ngreat, both on printed photos (local printer and through online service) and on screen.  Given that\\nthe camera was not cheap, I was a little dissapointed that I then had to dish out more money on the\\nfollowing: -memory card - it only comes with 8 MB, you probably want at least 32 MB  -rechargable\\nbatteries and a charger -better editing software than comes with camera -cable for serial port (only\\nan issue if you don\\'t have USB, but you really need USB or the pictures take forever to download).\",\\n\"I had a very hard time deciding on just what digital camera I was going to buy.  Should I get a 2.x\\nmegapixel cam  or should I spend a few extra bucks to get the C-3000 zoom, which happens to be\\nthe lowest priced 3.3 with the features that this camera has.  Well, obviously I chose the C-3000 and\\nI could not have made a better decision.  All of the features and extras are just the beginning of this\\ncameras greatness.  I was absolutely stunned by the incredible quality of the pictures that this\\ncamera produces.  With a good printer and some photo paper, you won\\'t even notice the difference\\nbetween homemade pictures and professionally developed film pictures.  Even large 8 X 10 pictures\\nare crystal clear with this cam.  When you first use this cam, you may be confused by the many\\noptions you have, but after a day or two of playing around and reading the instruction book, you will\\nbe able to make the most out of every photo.  If you are one of those people who absolutely hate\\nauto focus, don\\'t worry.  It has it.  It also allows you to control aperture and shutter speed, allowing\\nyou to leave the shutter open for a full 16 seconds, allowing you to create amazing effects.  By the\\nsecond night I had the cam, I produced a neat looking picture of a car with the appearance of the\\nlights tailing behind it thanks to the control you have of shutter speed and flashing.  If you just want\\nsimplicity, the C-3000 can do that too.  If you are not into being in control of your photos, just point\\nand click.  If you do not like your photo, you can immediately view and delete it to avoid wasted\\nspace.  I can\\'t even estimate how much film I have lost because of bad pictures that I wish I could\\ntake back.  If scenery is your thing, then you will love the panoramic feature.  With the aid of a\\ntripod, you can make full 360 degree panoramics.  You take each part of the panoramic individually\\nwith the aid of the veiwfinder, and the computer software will combine the pictures allowing you to\\ncreate a true panoramic, not the fake kind found in Advanced Photo System cameras.  If taking a\\npanoramic seems to complicated for you, then just switch it over to movie mode.  Depending on the\\nmemory you have, you can record anywhere from 30 second to 10 minute video clips, all with\\nsound.  If I were to continue listing all of the features, my hands would fall off from typing too much. \\nWhether you are an avid photographer looking for complete control of every shot or a person\\nlooking for a simple digital cam that takes great pictures, this cam is perfect for you.  There is one\\nquestion about this camera that I do not feel that I could answer.  What can\\'t the C-3000 do???\",\\n\"The Olympus C-3000 (now priced ...) is a wonderful buy. In its league it is by far the best digital\\ncamera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera\\'s with the same resolution cost a lot more.\\nThis camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was\\ndisappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better\\nthan a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature.It has\\npretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you\\nmight find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as\\nAMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money.This camera comes with the cables that let\\nyou connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a\\ncarrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are\\ntaking (which is a good thing !).You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer\\n(make sure you\\'ve got a USB port in your pc and you\\'ve got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not\\nwork for you.It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay.I\\nrecommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a\\nlot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You\\'ll run out of this easily.There are other\\ncameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply\\nwonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger,\\nthe batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.\"'"
