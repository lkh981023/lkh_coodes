                these countries are all belongs to the
                developed countries and this could explain why
                these countries have relatively high life satisfaction indices;
                because they have comprehensive public facilities

        <p>This section shows the overview of relationship between working hour
            and happiness index.And the cluster analysis result will also be shown in this section. I'm apply
            the cluster analysis while using KMeans algorithms with K=3🧐
        </p>
        <p>In this section you will also see the ratio: work-life ratio🤔. We define this ratio as: </p>
        <p>Working-life ratio = Average annual working hour / Life satisfaction index</p>
        <p>Assuming the working hour is relatively fixed, the higher ratio means that this country’s
            working-life balance cannot be achieved
            well since they have low life satisfaction index...😞 </p>
